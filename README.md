some code I kludged together to get a count of lines of code compiled
in the [Scala community build](https://github.com/scala/community-builds)

rather than just a raw line count, it uses `cloc` to get a proper
count that omits comments and blank lines

context: https://github.com/scala/community-builds/issues/59

also serves as a near-minimal example of a Scala compiler plugin for my
"Compiler Plugins 101" talk ([video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwji8KSXsu3cAhVKj1QKHYwUAXIQwqsBMAB6BAgGEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dh5NZjuxS5Qo&usg=AOvVaw1EEOQppRF3TGdMmoqZtNi0), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KtJMd27yGWmr7E2yxKC_ipMeaP_vr1-6wVJ-QcqS_Vc/edit?usp=sharing))
